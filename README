 make

LAUNCHING

(launches on port 8080)
or
 ./opawhiteboard.exe -p nnnn

Once started you can start drawing with people but it will not support reloading.

http://myhost:myport/i_m_a_builder
it aims to build the image and send it back to the server.
When we have an image manipulation library on server side, it won't be needed anymore.
